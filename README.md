# 1001ArabidopsisGenomes_RFLPs

A list of all the RFLP sites that are variable among the 1001 Arabidopsis genomes for EcoRI, BamHI, NotI, PstI, and HindIII. The genotypes of all 1135 lineages are also listed at each of those sites. If you'd like another restriction enzyme added, please get in touch (joel.sharbrough@nmt.edu), or feel free to use the code posted here to do it yourself. Amplicons and primers for selected markers are also posted here.
